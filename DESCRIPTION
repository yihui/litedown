Description: Render R Markdown to Markdown (without using 'knitr'), and Markdown
    to lightweight HTML/'LaTeX' documents with the 'commonmark' package (instead
    of 'Pandoc'). Some missing Markdown features in 'commonmark' are also
    supported, such as raw HTML/'LaTeX' blocks, 'LaTeX' math, superscripts,
    subscripts, footnotes, element attributes, appendices, and fenced 'Divs',
    but not all 'Pandoc' Markdown features are (or will be) supported. With
    additional JavaScript and CSS, you can also create HTML slides and articles.
    This package can be viewed as a trimmed-down version of R Markdown and
    'knitr'. It does not aim at rich Markdown features or a large variety of
    output formats (the primary formats are HTML and 'LaTeX'). Book and website
    projects of multiple input documents are also supported.
