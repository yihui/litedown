title: "Test inline expressions"
---

A normal inline expression: `{r} pi`.

The knitr-style inline expressions are ignored by default: `r pi`.

An expression that spans multiple lines: `{r} pi +
1 -
1`.

When a line has leading spaces that are not meaningful,
 it should still work: `{r} pi`.

<!-- doesn't work when the next line has leading spaces, e.g., `{r} pi +
 1` -->

- An item.

  `{r} pi` (leading spaces are meaningful here)
  
  hi `{r} pi > 1 & FALSE`
   hi `{r} pi`
  
  <!-- doesn't work: hi `{r} pi +
  1` -->

      hi `{r} pi` (four spaces: this is a plain code block)
