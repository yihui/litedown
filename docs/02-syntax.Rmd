# Markdown Syntax

## Basic syntax

For the full list of supported document elements, please read the GFM spec.
Below is a quick summary:

-   Headings start with a number of `#`'s, e.g., `## level-two heading`.

-   Inline elements: `**strong**`, `_emphasis_`, `~~strikethrough~~`,
    `[text](link)`, and `![alt](image/path)`.[^02-syntax-1]

-   Inline code is written in a pair of backticks, e.g., `` `code` ``. Code
    blocks can be indented, or fenced by ```` ``` ````.

-   List items start with `-`, `+`, or `*`, e.g., `- item`. A task list item is
    a regular list item with `[ ]` or `[x]` in the beginning, e.g.,
    `- [ ] item`.

-   Block quotes start with `>`.

-   Tables are created with `|` as the column separator (i.e., Pandoc's pipe
    table, which can be generated by `knitr::kable(x, "pipe")` or
    `xfun::md_table()`).

[^02-syntax-1]: Please note that for links and images, their URLs [should not
    contain spaces](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/#link-destination). If
    they do, the URLs must be enclosed in `<>`, e.g.,
    `![alt](<some dir/a subdir/foo.png>).`

## Add-on features

In addition to GFM features, the **litedown** package also supports the
following features.

### Raw LaTeX/HTML blocks

Raw LaTeX and HTML blocks can be written as fenced code blocks with language
names `=latex` (or `=tex`) and `=html`, e.g.,

```` markdown
```{=tex}
This only appears in \LaTeX{} output.
```
````

Raw LaTeX blocks will only appear in LaTeX output, and will be ignored in other
output formats. Similarly, raw HTML blocks will only appear in HTML output. One
exception is raw LaTeX blocks that are LaTeX math environments, which also work
for HTML output (see the next section).

### LaTeX math

You can write both `$inline$` and `$$display$$` LaTeX math, e.g.,
$\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) = 1$

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$

$$|x| = \begin{cases}
x &\text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x &\text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

LaTeX math environments are also supported, e.g., below are an `align`
environment and an `equation` environment:

```{=latex}
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} & =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) & =  1
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(a+b)^2 &=(a+b)(a+b)\\
  &=a^2+2ab+b^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```
These math environments can be written in raw LaTeX blocks, and they work for
both LaTeX and HTML output, e.g.,

```` markdown
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} & =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) & =  1
\end{align}
```
````

For HTML output, it is up to the JavaScript library (MathJax or KaTeX) whether a
math environment can be rendered.

### Superscripts and subscripts

Write superscripts in `^text^` and subscripts in `~text~` (same syntax as
Pandoc's Markdown), e.g., 2^10^ and H~2~O. Currently only alphanumeric
characters, `*`, `(`, and `)` are allowed in the scripts. For example, `a^b c^`
will not be recognized as a superscript (because the space is not allowed). Note
that GFM supports striking out text via `~text~`, but this feature has been
disabled and replaced by the feature of subscripts in **litedown**. To strike
out text, you must use a pair of *double* tildes.

### Footnotes

Insert footnotes via `[^n]`, where `n` is a footnote number (a unique
identifier). The footnote content should be defined in a separate block starting
with `[^n]:`. For example:

``` markdown
Insert a footnote here.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```

The support is limited for LaTeX output at the moment,[^02-syntax-2] and there
are two caveats if the document is intended to be converted to LaTeX:

[^02-syntax-2]: If you know C, I'll truly appreciate it if you could help with
    the LaTeX implementation in GFM:
    <https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/issues/314>

-   The footnote content must be a single paragraph.

-   Only numbers[^02-syntax-3] are supported as identifiers, and other types of
    identifiers are not recognized.

[^02-syntax-3]: The specific number doesn't matter, as long as it's a unique
    footnote number in the document. For example, the first footnote can be
    `[^100]` and the second can be `[^64]`. Eventually they will appear as `[1]`
    and `[2]`. If you use the RStudio visual editor to edit Markdown documents,
    the footnote numbers will be automatically generated and updated when new
    footnotes are inserted before existing footnotes.

The two limitations do not apply to HTML output, e.g., you can write arbitrary
elements in footnotes and not necessarily one paragraph.

### Attributes

Attributes on images, links, fenced code blocks, and section headings can be
written in `{}`. For example, `![text](path){.foo #bar width="50%"}` will
generate an `<img>` tag with attributes in HTML output:

``` html
<img src="path" alt="text" id="bar" class="foo" width="50%" />
```

and `## Heading {#baz}` will generate:

``` html
<h2 id="baz">Heading</h2>
```

For fenced code blocks, a special rule is that the first class name will be
treated as the language name for a block, and the `class` attribute of the
result `<code>` tag will have a `language-` prefix. For example, the following
code block

```` markdown
```{.foo .bar #my-code style="color: red;"}
```
````

will generate the HTML output below:

``` html
<pre>
  <code class="language-foo bar" id="my-code" style="color: red;">
  </code>
</pre>
```

Most attributes in `{}` are ignored for LaTeX output except for:

-   The `width` attribute for images, e.g., `![text](path){width="50%"}` will be
    converted to `\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{path}`.

-   The `.unnumbered` attribute, which will make a heading unnumbered, e.g.,
    `# Hello {.unnumbered}` will be converted to `\section*{Hello}`.

-   The `.appendix` attribute on a heading, which will start the appendix, e.g.,
    `# Appendix {.appendix}` will be converted to `\appendix`.

### Appendices

When a top-level heading has the attribute `.appendix`, the rest of the document
will be treated as the appendix. If section numbering is enabled
(@sec-number-sections), the appendix section headings will be numbered
differently.

### Fenced `Div`s

A fenced `Div` can be written in `:::` fences. Note that the opening fence must
have at least one attribute, such as the class name. For example:

``` markdown
::: foo
This is a fenced Div.
:::

::: {.foo}
The syntax `::: foo` is equivalent to `::: {.foo}`.
:::

::: {.foo #bar style="color: red;"}
This div has more attributes.

It will be red in HTML output.
:::
```

A fenced `Div` will be converted to `<div>` with attributes in HTML output,
e.g.,

``` html
<div class="foo" id="bar" style="color: red;">
</div>
```

For LaTeX output, it can be converted to a LaTeX environment if both the class
name and an attribute `data-latex` are present. For example,

``` markdown
::: {.tiny data-latex=""}
This is _tiny_ text.
:::
```

will be converted to:

``` latex
\begin{tiny}
This is \emph{tiny} text.
\end{tiny}
```

The `data-latex` attribute can be used to specify arguments to the environment
(which can be an empty string if the environment doesn't need an argument). For
example,

``` markdown
::: {.minipage data-latex="{.5\linewidth}"}
```

will be converted to:

``` latex
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
```

If a fenced `Div` doesn't have the `data-latex` attribute, the fence will be
ignored, and its content will be written out normally without a surrounding
environment. If a fenced `Div` has multiple class names (e.g., `{.a .b .c}`),
only the first class name will be used as the LaTeX environment name. However,
all class names will be used if the output format is HTML (e.g.,
`<div class="a b c">`).

### Cross-references

To cross-reference an element, it must be numberd first. For section headings,
the numbers are automatically generated if the `number_sections` option is true.
For other elements, they must contain empty anchors of the form `[](#@ID)`,
where `ID` is the ID of the element to be referenced. For figures, these anchors
are automatically generated if the chunk options `fig.cap` (figure caption) and
`fig.env` are not empty, e.g.,

```` md
```{r}
#| nice-plot, fig.cap="A nice caption", fig.env=".figure"

plot(cars)
```
````

To refer to an element in the text, use the syntax `@ID`, e.g.,

``` md
Please see @fig-nice-plot for an overview of the `cars` data.
```

### Citations

This feature requires the R package **rbibutils**. Please make sure it is
installed before using citations.

``` r
xfun::pkg_load2("rbibutils")
```

To insert citations, you have to first declare one or multiple bibliography
databases in the YAML metadata, e.g.,

``` yaml
bibliography: ["papers.bib", "books.bib"]
```

Each `.bib` file contains entries that start with keywords. For example,
`R-base` is the keyword for the following entry:

``` plain
@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2024},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```

Then you can use `[@R-base]` or `@R-base` to cite this item. The keywords must
consist of only alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and `-`. You can
include multiple keywords in `[ ]` separated by semicolons.

For HTML output, the citation uses the author-year style. The syntax
`[@keyword]` generates the citation in parentheses (e.g., `(Author, 2024)`), and
`@keyword` only puts the year in parentheses (e.g., `Author (2024)`).

For LaTeX output, the citation style depends on the LaTeX package, which you can
set via the `citation_package` option of the output format in YAML metadata,
e.g.,

``` yaml
output:
  litedown::latex_format:
    citation_package: biblatex
```

The default is `natbib`. The table below shows the LaTeX commands corresponding
to the Markdown citation syntax:

| citation package | `[@key-1; @key-2]`          | `@key`        |
|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| none             | `\cite{key-1, key-2}`       | `\cite{key}`  |
| natbib           | `\citep{key-1, key-2}`      | `\citet{key}` |
| biblatex         | `\parencite{key-1, key-2}`  | `\cite{key}`  |

Note that **litedown** actually generates `\citep` and `\citet` regardless of
the citation package, but will redefine them to `\cite` or `\parencite`
according to the citation package. For example, it will insert
`\let\citep\parencite` in the LaTeX preamble when `citation_package` is
`biblatex`.

### Smart HTML entities

"Smart" HTML entities can be represented by ASCII characters, e.g., you can
write fractions in the form `n/m`. Below are some example entities:

```{r, smartypants, echo=FALSE}
p = litedown:::pants[-(4:14)]
t(as.matrix(setNames(p, sprintf('`%s`', names(p)))))
```

## Comparison to Pandoc

As mentioned earlier, a lot of features in Pandoc's Markdown are not supported
in the **litedown** package. Any feature that you find missing in previous
sections is likely to be unavailable. In addition, a lot of R Markdown and
Quarto (both are based on Pandoc) features are not supported, either. Some HTML
features have been implemented via JavaScript and CSS.

Pandoc can convert Markdown to many output formats, such as Word, PowerPoint,
LaTeX beamer, and EPUB. The **litedown** package is unlikely to support output
formats beyond HTML and LaTeX.
