## Live preview

Unless it has become your muscle memory to click on the `Knit` button in
RStudio, you may try to switch to `litedown::roam()` to preview your HTML output
by clicking on the `run` buttons in the user interface. Note that the preview
takes place *in memory only*. Although you see an HTML page rendered from a file
in the preview, the page is not rendered to disk, unless you click on the
`render` button (@sec:the-buttons), or call `litedown::fuse()` (@chp:fuse) or
`mark()` (@chp:mark) on the file.

### Live reload

By default, the preview will automatically refresh the content after you edit
and save a file. If you prefer building the document only when you want to, you
can turn off the live preview via `litedown::roam(live = FALSE)`. In this case,
the document will be rebuilt only when you refresh the page by yourself.

### The file listing

After launching the preview via `litedown::roam()`, a file listing will be
displayed, which shows the first few lines of `*.R`, `*.Rmd`, and `*.md` files
in boxes, followed by the list of other files.

By clicking on plain-text files, you will see their full content. For binary
files, they may be opened in your browser; if they cannot be opened, the browser
may prompt to download the file.

Each file will have its size displayed after the filename, with a link attached
to the file size. The link points to the raw file (the behavior of the link is
up to the browser—the file may be opened or downloaded), and **litedown** will
not process it at all.

The full path of the file or directory being previewed is displayed at the top
left.

For `.R`, `.Rmd`, and `.md` files, you can click on the "Run" button
([⏵](){.larger}) to render them to HTML in memory and preview the output. This
button is displayed at the top right of each file box on the listing page, and
at the top right of the preview page of an individual file.

::: callout-caution
Rendering `.R` and `.Rmd` files via the `Run` button means *the full R code* in
them will be executed. If the R code involves intensive computing, it may not be
a good idea to run the whole file, unless you have taken measures to speed up
the computing (e.g., via caching).

### The buttons

There is a button group at the top right of the preview page.

-   The `render` button (with the lightning or voltage icon, [↯](){.larger}):
    Render a document or project in a new R session and save the output file(s)
    to disk, which is similar to what the `Knit` button does in RStudio.

    You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + K` (or `Command + K` on
    macOS).

-   The `edit` buttons (with a pencil icon, [✎](){.larger}): Open the source
    file of the current page in your default editor if possible.

-   The `back`/`forward` buttons (with arrow icons, [←](){.larger} and
    [→](){.larger}): Go back/forward through the browsing history, similar to
    the back/forward buttons on web browser toolbars.

    You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `Alt + Left` / `Alt + Right`.

-   The `add` button (with the plus icon, [+](){.larger}): Create a new `.Rmd` /
    `.md` / `.R` file with selected HTML features.

-   The `refresh` button (with the refresh icon, [⟳](){.larger}): Refresh the
    page. If you are previewing an `.Rmd` file, refreshing the page will rebuild
    it.

    You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + R` (or `Command + R` on
    macOS).

-   The `printer` button (with a printer icon, [⎙](){.larger}): Bring up the
    printer dialog, e.g., to print the page to PDF.

Code blocks in the preview mode will have line numbers automatically added to
their left. If you click on a line number, it will bring you to that line in the
source document.

Note that the keyboard shortcuts require the page to be currently on focus
before they can take effect. This is important when you are viewing a page
inside RStudio or other IDEs, because the viewer may not gain focus
automatically, and you will have to explicitly click on it.

### Cleaning up

Previewing `.Rmd` and `.R` files that generate plots will leave `*__files/`
directories (containing plot files) on disk by default. If you want to clean up
such directories when closing or navigating away from the preview page, you may
set the option

``` r
options(litedown.roam.cleanup = TRUE)
```

before you run `litedown::roam()` or in your `.Rprofile`. Note that it will not
clean up a `*__files/` directory if it has existed before you preview a file.
This is to make sure `roam()` will not delete existing files by accident. If you
are certain that a `*__files/` directory can be safely deleted, you can always
delete it by hand. After that, `roam()` will automatically clean it up when you
preview the file again.

Please also note that when caching is enabled (via the chunk option
`cache = TRUE`) in the file being previewed, the `*__files/` directory will not
be cleaned up, because when a code chunk is cached, it will not be re-evaluated
or re-generate plots next time (unless the cache is invalidated).

## Visual editor

Since the Markdown syntax of **litedown** can be viewed as a subset of Pandoc's
Markdown, you can use RStudio's visual Markdown editor to author documents.
Please bear in mind that most common, but not all, Markdown features are
supported.

## The `Knit` button {#sec:knit-button}

If you use the RStudio IDE, the `Knit` button can render R Markdown to a
**litedown** output format specified in YAML (e.g., `html` or `latex`). Please
also remember to add a top-level setting `knit: litedown:::knit` in YAML,
otherwise RStudio will either throw an error if you use the output format `html`
or `latex`, or use `rmarkdown::render()` instead of `litedown::fuse()` to render
the document.

``` yaml
---
output: html
knit: litedown:::knit
---
```
