A Markdown document consists of a YAML frontmatter providing the document
metadata, and a Markdown body. The frontmatter is optional, and (if provided)
should be written using the syntax introduced in @sec:yaml-syntax. The syntax
for the body is introduced in @sec:markdown-basic and @sec:markdown-addon.

## YAML syntax

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", which aims at being a
"human-friendly data serialization language". You may judge how "human-friendly"
it is[^03-syntax-1] by yourself after reading its specifications at
<https://yaml.org>.

[^03-syntax-1]: At least [it was not quite friendly to
    Norwegian](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36745212) until YAML 1.2.

What we introduce in this section is a significantly trimmed-down version of
YAML. Its official name is "TRACY", a recursive acronym for "TRACY Really Ain't
Complete YAML" and also in honor of [Tracy
Teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Teal) since she was once a nice boss
of mine. However, to follow the naming convention of `*ML`, we use the name
"TAML" (with apologies for the further recursion) when the audience has some
software background.

The following example shows all types of data that TAML supports:

``` yaml
a: 1
b: "string"
c: true
d: null
# e is also null
e:
# an expression
f: !expr 1 + 1
# vectors
g: [1, 2, 3]
h: ["foo", "bar"]
# a nested list
i:
  i1: -1e8
  i2: "another string"
  i3:
    i31: [true, false, true]
any_character.is-okay: string not quoted
```

The TAML specifications are:

1.  Each line should be of the form `field: value`. The `field` name can use any
    character (except a leading `#` or a colon followed by a space). The `value`
    cannot span across multiple lines. A line starting with `#` is treated as a
    comment. Any line not of the form `field: value` is ignored.

2.  Values must be character, numeric, logical, expressions, null, or vectors.

    -   Character strings are quoted in either single or double quotes. Quotes
        are optional when the values cannot be interpreted as other types of
        values (e.g., numeric or logical).

    -   Numeric values must consist of numbers (0-9), `+`, `-`, and `e`, and can
        be converted to numbers.

    -   Logical values must be either `true` or `false`. No other values are
        recognized, such as `yes`, `YES`, `no`, `NO`,[^03-syntax-2] `on`, `off`,
        `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `T`, `F`, `to be`, or `not to be` .

    -   Expressions start with `!expr` followed by R code.

    -   Null values can be either literally `null` or empty.

    -   A vector consists of comma-separated character/numeric/logical values in
        `[ ]`.

3.  If `value` is empty, and the next line is of the form `field: value`
    indented by $n$ white spaces ($n \geq 1$),[^03-syntax-3] the next line will
    be treated as a child member of the current line. One field can have
    multiple children indented to the same level, and each child can have its
    children (further indented by $n$ spaces).

[^03-syntax-2]: TAML is a good friend of Norwegian.

[^03-syntax-3]: Most people may want to use 2 or 4 spaces. Avoid 8, because that
    has been reserved for a VIP in the R club, [Roger
    Peng](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2018-07-27-why-i-indent-my-code-8-spaces/).
    You may also choose to use tabs. If you *really* want to, you can mix tabs
    with spaces (then $n$ is the total number of them). If people tell you that
    you are crazy by mixing up things, don't listen and never follow. TAML is
    human-friendly and respects the space right of all human beings. Guess what
    happens if you indent one line by 2 spaces and the next line by 3 spaces
    when you meant to use 4 spaces?

TAML is implemented in `xfun::taml_load()` and used by **litedown**. See
@sec:yaml-metadata for all possible fields supported in **litedown**.

## Basic Markdown {#sec:markdown-basic}

If you cannot learn the basic Markdown in this section (i.e.,
@sec:markdown-basic) in a few minutes, please feel free to file [a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/yihui/litedown/issues) and I will send you a
sponsorship of \$20 on GitHub.

### Inline elements

You can write these elements inline: `**strong**`, `_emphasis_`, `` `code` ``,
`~~strikethrough~~`, `[text](link)`, and `![alt](image/path)`.

::: callout-note
For links and images, their URLs [should not contain
spaces](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/#link-destination). If they do, the
URLs must be enclosed in `<>`, e.g., `![alt](<some dir/a subdir/foo.png>).`
:::

The rest of elements in this section are block-level elements.

### Headings

Headings start with a number of `#`'s, e.g., `## level-two heading`.

You are recommended to use `##` (level-two) as the top heading level in a
document, except for books, in which case each document is a chapter and you
should use `#` (level-one) as the top level.

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

### Code blocks

Code blocks can be indented by 4 spaces, or fenced by ```` ``` ````. In the
latter case, the code block can have a class name (typically the language name).
For example, below is a JS code block:

```` md
```js
x < 0 ? -x : x;
```
````

### Lists

There are three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and task lists.

An unordered list item starts with `-`, `+`, or `*`, e.g., `- item`.

A task list item is a regular list item with `[ ]` (unchecked) or `[x]`
(checked) in the beginning, e.g., `- [ ] item`.

An ordered list item starts with a number followed by a period. The number of
the first item is used as the starting number of the list, and the rest of
numbers can be arbitrary. The examples on the left below are equivalent to those
on the right:

::: flex-col
``` md
1. Get up!
1. Write a book!
1. Go to bed!
```

``` md
1. Get up!
2. Write a book!
3. Go to bed!
```
:::

::: flex-col
``` md
5. Get up!
100. Write a book!
1. Go to bed!
```

``` md
5. Get up!
6. Write a book!
7. Go to bed!
```
:::

### Block quotes

Block quotes start with `>` followed by a space and then the quote. A quote can
contain any number of any Markdown elements. If it contains multiple block-level
elements, each line needs to start with `>`. For example, below is a block quote
with multiple paragraphs:

``` md
> "You're an oaf. I told you quite distinctly to make his discharge papers out."
>
> And all the bile which had accumulated in the judge advocate's soul in the course of that day because of Captain Linhart and Švejk poured out like a wild torrent on the head of the staff warder. At the end of it Bernis said:
>
> "And now do you understand that you are a prize royal oaf?"
>
> This is something which should only be said to kings and emperors, but even this simple staff warder, who was no royal personage, was not very pleased about it.
>
> ---Jaroslav Hašek, _The Good Soldier Švejk_ (Chapter 9)
```

### Tables

Tables are created with `|` as the column separator, i.e., Pandoc's pipe table,
which can be generated by `xfun::md_table(x)` or `knitr::kable(x, "pipe")` if
you want to create a table from a rectangular object `x` in R.

``` md
| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
|:------|------:|:-----:|
| row 1 | row 1 | row 1 |
| row 2 | row 2 | row 2 |
```

The position of the colon below the table header controls the column alignment,
e.g., a colon on the right means the column is right-aligned, and colons on both
ends means the column is center-aligned.

## Add-on features {#sec:markdown-addon}

In addition to the basic features above (supported by **commonmark**), the
**litedown** package also supports the following features.

### Raw LaTeX/HTML blocks

Raw LaTeX and HTML blocks can be written as fenced code blocks with language
names `=latex` and `=html`, e.g.,

```` markdown
```{=latex}
This only appears in \LaTeX{} output.
```
````

Raw LaTeX blocks will only appear in LaTeX output, and will be ignored in other
output formats. Similarly, raw HTML blocks will only appear in HTML output. One
exception is raw LaTeX blocks that are LaTeX math environments, which also work
for HTML output (see the next section).

### LaTeX math

You can write both `$inline$` and `$$display$$` LaTeX math, e.g.,
$\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) = 1$.

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$

$$|x| = \begin{cases}
x &\text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x &\text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

For expressions in pairs of single or double dollar signs to be recognized as
LaTeX math, there must be no spaces after the opening dollar sign, or before the
closing dollar sign. The math expression should either start from the very
beginning of a line, or have a space or `(` before the opening dollar sign.

-   For a pair of single dollar signs, they must be on the same line in the
    text, and the closing dollar sign should not be followed by a number (to
    avoid detecting math mistakenly from text like "a \$5 bill and a \$10
    bill"). The inner math expression should not be wrapped in backticks.

-   For `$$ $$` expressions, they can span over multiple lines, in which case
    the closing `$$` must have at least one non-space character before it, and
    no spaces after it.

Valid examples:

``` tex
$x + y$
($x + y$)
  $x + y$
text $x + y$ text

$$x + y$$
  $$x + y$$
text $$x + y$$ text
$$x +
  y$$
```

Invalid examples:

``` md
$ x + y$  <- space after the opening `$`
text$x + y$  <- lack of space before the opening `$`
text $x + y$10 text  <- number after closing `$`
$x +
y$  <- multi-line `$ $` expressions
$`x + y`$  <- expression wrapped in backticks

$$x +
  y
$$
^- lack of non-space character before closing `$$`
```

LaTeX math environments are also supported, e.g., below are an `align`
environment and an `equation` environment:

```{md, attr.source = '.tex', attr.asis = '.callout-output'}
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} & =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) & =  1
\label{eq:pyth-identity}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  (a+b)^2 &=(a+b)(a+b)\\
    &=a^2+2ab+b^2
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
```

These math environments can be written as either nake LaTeX code or raw LaTeX
blocks (```` ```{=latex} ````), but we recommend that you use raw LaTeX blocks
because they are more robust. LaTeX math environments work for both LaTeX and
HTML output.

For HTML output, it is up to the JavaScript library (MathJax or KaTeX) whether a
math environment can be rendered (@sec:js-math).

### Superscripts and subscripts

Write superscripts in `^text^` and subscripts in `~text~` (same syntax as
Pandoc's Markdown), e.g., 2^10^ and H~2~O. Currently only alphanumeric
characters, `*`, `(`, and `)` are allowed in the scripts. For example, `a^b c^`
will not be recognized as a superscript (because the space is not allowed). Note
that GFM supports striking out text via `~text~`, but this feature has been
disabled and replaced by the feature of subscripts in **litedown**. To strike
out text, you must use a pair of *double* tildes.

### Footnotes

Insert footnotes via `[^n]`, where `n` is a footnote number (a unique
identifier). The footnote content should be defined in a separate block starting
with `[^n]:`. For example:

``` markdown
Insert a footnote here.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```

The support is limited for LaTeX output at the moment, and there are two caveats
if the document is intended to be converted to LaTeX:

-   The footnote content must be a single paragraph.

-   Only numbers[^03-syntax-4] are supported as identifiers, and other types of
    identifiers are not recognized.

[^03-syntax-4]: The specific number doesn't matter, as long as it's a unique
    footnote number in the document. For example, the first footnote can be
    `[^100]` and the second can be `[^64]`. Eventually they will appear as `[1]`
    and `[2]`. If you use the RStudio visual editor to edit Markdown documents,
    the footnote numbers will be automatically generated and updated when new
    footnotes are inserted before existing footnotes.

The two limitations do not apply to HTML output, e.g., you can write arbitrary
elements in footnotes and not necessarily one paragraph.

### Attributes

Attributes on images, links, fenced code blocks, and section headings can be
written in `{}`. ID and class are two common attributes. An ID can be written
after the `#` character, and a class can be written after `.` . Attributes are
typically written in the form `name="value"`, and separated by spaces (in fact,
you can also write IDs and classes explicitly like other attributes, e.g.,
`id="foo" class="bar"`). Certain attributes do not require values, and you can
provide the attribute name only, e.g., `disabled` or `contenteditable`, although
it is harmless to write `disabled="true"`.

::: callout-note
Only lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), hyphens (`-`), and colons (`:`) are
allowed in ID and class strings. For example, `sec:intro` and `fig-cars` are
valid IDs, but `sec_intro` and `tab cars` are not.
:::

For example, `![text](path){.foo #bar width="50%"}` will generate an `<img>` tag
with attributes in HTML output:

``` html
<img src="path" alt="text" id="bar" class="foo" width="50%" />
```

and `## Heading {#baz}` will generate:

``` html
<h2 id="baz">Heading</h2>
```

Links of the form `[text](url){...}` will generate:

``` html
<a href="url" ...></a>
```

When the `url` is empty, `<a>` will be converted to `<span>`, e.g.,
`[text](){.foo .bar}` will generate:

``` html
<span class="foo bar">text</span>
```

This provides a way to create `<span>` elements, which is similar to [bracketed
`Span`s](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-bracketed_spans) (i.e.,
`[text]{...}`) in Pandoc's Markdown.

For fenced code blocks, a special rule is that the first class name will be
treated as the language name for a block, and the `class` attribute of the
result `<code>` tag will have a `language-` prefix. For example, the following
code block

```` markdown
```{.foo .bar #my-code style="color: red;"}
```
````

will generate the HTML output below:

``` html
<pre>
  <code class="language-foo bar" id="my-code" style="color: red;">
  </code>
</pre>
```

Most attributes in `{}` are ignored for LaTeX output except for:

-   The `width` attribute for images, e.g., `![text](path){width="50%"}` will be
    converted to `\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{path}`.

-   The `.unnumbered` attribute, which will make a heading unnumbered, e.g.,
    `# Hello {.unnumbered}` will be converted to `\section*{Hello}`.

-   The `.appendix` attribute on a heading, which will start the appendix, e.g.,
    `# Appendix {.appendix}` will be converted to `\appendix`.

-   The ID attributes on headings, which will be converted to `\label{}`, e.g.,
    `# Introduction {#sec:intro}` will be converted to
    `\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}`.

### Appendices

When a top-level heading has the attribute `.appendix`, the rest of the document
will be treated as the appendix. If section numbering is enabled
(@sec:number-sections), the appendix section headings will be numbered
differently.

### Fenced `Div`s

A fenced `Div` can be written in `:::` fences. Note that the opening fence must
have at least one attribute, such as the class name. For example:

``` markdown
::: foo
This is a fenced Div.
:::

::: {.foo}
The syntax `::: foo` is equivalent to `::: {.foo}`.
:::

::: {.foo #bar style="color: red;"}
This div has more attributes.

It will be red in HTML output.
:::
```

A fenced `Div` will be converted to `<div>` with attributes in HTML output,
e.g.,

``` html
<div class="foo" id="bar" style="color: red;">
</div>
```

For LaTeX output, it can be converted to a LaTeX environment if both the class
name and an attribute `data-latex` are present. For example,

``` markdown
::: {.tiny data-latex=""}
This is _tiny_ text.
:::
```

will be converted to:

``` latex
\begin{tiny}
This is \emph{tiny} text.
\end{tiny}
```

The `data-latex` attribute can be used to specify arguments to the environment
(which can be an empty string if the environment doesn't need an argument). For
example,

``` markdown
::: {.minipage data-latex="{.5\linewidth}"}
```

will be converted to:

``` latex
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
```

The `data-latex` attribute is optional for fenced `Div`s with class names
`figure` or `table`. They will be converted to `figure` or `table` environments.
For example,

``` markdown
:::: {.figure}
![](foo.png)

::: {.caption}
This is a caption.
:::
::::
```

will be converted to:

``` tex
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{foo.png}
  \caption{This is a caption.}
\end{figure}
```

Other fenced `Div`s will be ignored if they don't have the `data-latex`
attribute, and their inner content will be written out normally without a
surrounding environment.

If a fenced `Div` has multiple class names (e.g., `{.a .b .c}`), only the first
class name will be used as the LaTeX environment name. However, all class names
will be used if the output format is HTML (e.g., `<div class="a b c">`).

### Cross-references {#sec:cross-references}

To cross-reference an element, it must be numbered first. Then we can refer to
it by its ID.

#### Sections, figures, and tables

Section heading IDs can be either manually assigned or automatically generated
(@sec:auto-identifiers). Section numbers are automatically generated if the
`number_sections` option is true (@sec:number-sections).

Figures and tables are automatically numbered if their captions are provided
(via the chunk options `fig.cap` / `tab.cap`), e.g.,

```` md
```{r}
#| nice-plot, fig.cap = "A nice caption"

plot(cars)
```
````

To refer to an element in the text, use the syntax `@ID`, where `ID` is the ID
of the element to be referenced, which typically consists of a prefix (e.g.,
`sec:`, `fig:`, `tab:`, or `eq:`) and a label. For example:

``` md
Please see @fig:nice-plot for an overview of the `cars` data.
```

Hyphens (`-`) are also allowed in place of colons in the ID prefix, e.g.,
`@fig-nice-plot`.

#### LaTeX equations

LaTeX math environments such as `align` and `equation` are numbered by default.
To refer to an expression (e.g., an equation) in a math environment, a label
needs to be assigned to the expression first via `\label{}`, and it must start
with the prefix `eq:` or `eq-`, e.g.,

```` md
```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 \label{eq:pyth-identity}
\end{equation}
```
````

Then we can use either `@eq:*` or `@eqn:*` to cross-reference the equation,
e.g., `@eqn:pyth-identity`. Under the hood, the prefix `@eq` will be resolved to
`\ref{}`, and `@eqn` will be resolved to `\eqref{}`. If you are not familiar
with LaTeX commands `\ref{}` and `\eqref{}`, the main difference is that
`\eqref{}` will render the equation number in parentheses, e.g.,
@eqn:pyth-identity, whereas `\ref{}` will only generate the equation number,
e.g., @eq:pyth-identity.

In HTML output, `\eqref{}` will also add a label "Equation" before the number by
default. If you prefer writing the label manually and having control over the
parentheses, you can use `@eq:` instead of `@eqn:`, e.g., `Eq. [@eq:*]` (using
the label "Eq." and square brackets).

In addition to equation numbers, you can also specify a tag for an equation via
`\tag{}` and refer to the equations by its tag, e.g.,

```{md, attr.source = '.tex', attr.asis = '.callout-output'}
For a right-angled triangle, we are all familiar with @eqn:pyth-theorem.

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \label{eq:pyth-theorem} \tag{PT}
\end{equation}
```

#### Arbitrary elements

You can cross-reference any other type of elements by adding empty anchors of
the form `[](#@ID)` into them, e.g.,

````{md, attr.asis = '.callout-output'}
:::: {#lst:example .box}
::: caption
[](#@lst:example) A code listing demonstrating how to fold code blocks with JS.
:::

```js
document.querySelectorAll('pre').forEach(pre => {
  const d = document.createElement('details');
  d.innerHTML = '<summary>Details</summary>';
  pre.before(d);  // insert <details> before <pre>
  d.append(pre);  // move <pre> into <details>
});
```
::::

We can cross-reference @lst:example.
````

```{css, echo = FALSE}
[id^="lst:"] code[class] { background-color: inherit; }
```

Note that we also added the ID (`#lst:example`) to the fenced Div to make it the
target of the cross reference, i.e., when you click on the reference, the
browser will navigate to the Div.

For HTML output, we can style the numbers and references with CSS. Element
numbers are wrapped in `<span class="ref-number-*"></span>`, and references are
wrapped in `<span class="cross-ref-*"></span>`, where `*` is the ID prefix
(e.g., `fig`, `tab`, and `eqn`). For example, we can add the label "Listing" to
the number and reference of the block above:

```{css}
.ref-number-lst::before, .cross-ref-lst::before {
  content: "Listing ";
}
.ref-number-lst {
  font-style: italic;
}
.ref-number-lst::after {
  content: ". "
}
```

### Citations

This feature requires the R package **rbibutils** [@R-rbibutils]. Please make
sure it is installed before using citations.

``` r
xfun::pkg_load2("rbibutils")
```

To insert citations, you have to first declare one or multiple bibliography
databases in the YAML metadata, e.g.,

``` yaml
bibliography: ["papers.bib", "books.bib"]
```

Each `.bib` file contains entries that start with keywords. For example,
`R-base` is the keyword for the following entry:

``` plain
@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2024},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```

Then you can use `[@R-base]` or `@R-base` to cite this item. The keywords must
consist of only alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and `-`. You can
include multiple keywords in `[ ]` separated by semicolons.

For HTML output, the citation uses the author-year style. The syntax
`[@keyword]` generates the citation in parentheses (e.g., `(Author, 2024)`), and
`@keyword` only puts the year in parentheses (e.g., `Author (2024)`). All
references will be put in a Div with the id `refs`, i.e.,
`<div id="refs"></div>`. This Div will appear at the end of the document by
default. If you want it to appear elsewhere, you can provide an empty Div there.

For LaTeX output, the citation style depends on the LaTeX package, which you can
set via the `citation_package` option of the output format in YAML metadata,
e.g.,

``` yaml
output:
  latex:
    citation_package: biblatex
```

The default is `natbib`. The table below shows the LaTeX commands corresponding
to the Markdown citation syntax:

| citation package | `[@key-1; @key-2]`         | `@key`        |
|------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| none             | `\cite{key-1, key-2}`      | `\cite{key}`  |
| natbib           | `\citep{key-1, key-2}`     | `\citet{key}` |
| biblatex         | `\parencite{key-1, key-2}` | `\cite{key}`  |

Note that **litedown** actually generates `\citep` and `\citet` regardless of
the citation package, but will redefine them to `\cite` or `\parencite`
according to the citation package. For example, it will insert
`\let\citep\parencite` in the LaTeX preamble when `citation_package` is
`biblatex`.

### Smart HTML entities

"Smart" HTML entities can be represented by ASCII characters, e.g., you can
write fractions in the form `n/m`. Below are some example entities:

```{r, smartypants, echo = FALSE}
p = litedown:::pants[-(4:14)]
t(as.matrix(setNames(p, sprintf('`%s`', names(p)))))
```

## Comparison to Pandoc

As mentioned earlier, a lot of features in Pandoc's Markdown are not supported
in the **litedown** package. Any feature that you find missing in previous
sections is likely to be unavailable. In addition, a lot of R Markdown and
Quarto (both are based on Pandoc) features are not supported, either. Some HTML
features have been implemented via JavaScript and CSS.

Pandoc can convert Markdown to many output formats, such as Word, PowerPoint,
LaTeX beamer, and EPUB. The **litedown** package is unlikely to support output
formats beyond HTML and LaTeX.
